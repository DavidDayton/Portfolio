# David Dayton's School Programming Project Portfolio!
Hello, my name is David Dayton, and I am a Computer Science major with a focus on Data Science at the University of Maryland, College Park.
In this portfolio, you will find projects in a variety of different programming languages showing off differing skills. 
These projects are also taken from multiple classes I have taken throughout my time as a student. 
An example of this is the solar flares project in this portfolio was my first ever project in Intro to Data Science. 

Every project will have their own README inside them giving a breif explination of the project itself and circumstances surronding them.
