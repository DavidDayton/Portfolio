# David Dayton's School Programming Project Portfolio!
Hello, my name is David Dayton, and I am a Computer Science major with a focus on Data Science at the University of Maryland, College Park.
In this portfolio, you will find projects in a variety of different programming languages showing off differing skills. 
These projects are also taken from multiple classes I have taken throughout my time as a student. 
An example of this is the first project in this portfolio was my first ever project in Intro to Data Science. 
This project was my first experience programming in Python and using Pandas.
I include this project not because it is perfect but instead because it was a pivotal moment in my life when I decided 
Data Science was something I would want to pursue due to how much fun I had working on the project. Never before had I ever felt this way working on a school project. 

Every project will have their own README inside them giving a breif explination of the project itself and circumstances surronding them.
