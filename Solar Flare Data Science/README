Solar Flare Data Science project for CMSC320 Intro to Data Science. 
This project was written in Python using Pandas within a Jupyter Notebook. 

In this project, we were given two copies of websites we were supposed to pull data from 
and compare against one another; then we were asked to answer three questions which you will 
see at the bottom of the file.

This was my first experience in data science, and it 
was what pulled me to specialize my degree in Data Science.

It is given in 3 different formats: HTML, PDF, and ipynb for whichever one is most convenient for you to observe.
