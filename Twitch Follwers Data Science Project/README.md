Final Data Science project for CMSC320 Intro to Data Science. 
This project was written in Python using Pandas within a Jupyter Notebook. 

The final project was a partner project in which I was tasked to collaborate with another student to create
a data science tutorial showing the entirety of the data science process. 

We decided to predict follower growth for the most popular streamers on Twitch.TV. 
Despite not being able to accurately predict follower growth, we got 100% on the project.
