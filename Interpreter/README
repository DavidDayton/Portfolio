Interpreter Project for CMSC330 Organization of Programming Languages. 
Written in OCaml.

In this project, I created a lexer, parser, and interpreter within OCaml for a 
smaller, more limited version of OCaml they called MicroCaml. 
The three files I worked on were lexer.ml, parser.ml, and eval.ml. The rest of the files within the zipped folder was provided to us 
as a part of the project, and I have given them to you for context.
